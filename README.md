Hi, I’m Shimo-Kota. I’m currently studying Engineering at the University of Tokyo. I have a keen interest in generative AI and am actively learning Python. I'm particularly interested in building systems using the LangChain library. Right now, I’m working on developing an automated document and business plan generation system.
